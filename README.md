# PlanetGen
A tool for generating planets for Science-Fiction environments through several randomized characteristics with realistic dependencies

Originally created for on-the-fly generation of planets for tabletop gaming, but can also be used for stories either directly or
as indirect inspiration. Dependencies are thoroughly thought out so only minimal additional imagination or tweaking is required 
in most circumstances if any characteristics are vague or seem to conflict.
